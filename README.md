# PyNcView
*PyNcView* is a cross-platform [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) viewer written in Python. 
It provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface to the creation of animations and publication-quality figures.

## Installation
The easiest way to install PyNcView is via [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) - ```pip install pyncview``` - the installation
will pull in a few dependencies automatically. Unfortunately PyQt - 4 or 5 - or PySide is not among them (no need to install 4 
 better use 5 - but if 4 is already installed it should be OK). Therefore it is 
necessary to install one of these *PyNcView* will work - multiple instructions on the net.
